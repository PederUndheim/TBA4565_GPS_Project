# GPS Project in TBA4565

This repository contains two projects completed in the course **Geomatics, Specialization Course (TBA4565)** at NTNU.  
Together, the projects explore two major approaches to GNSS positioning: **absolute positioning** and **relative high-precision positioning**.

---

### Project 1
Project 1 examines absolute point positioning using code pseudoranges, where satellite orbits, signal delays, and receiver coordinates are estimated through a least-squares adjustment. 

### Project 2
Project 2 addresses high-precision relative positioning using carrier-phase observations, emphasizing double differencing and integer ambiguity resolution.
